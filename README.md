playlist-restructurer
=====================

Reorganize your music folder according to the file's id3tags

Create another tree of your music files so they all follow the same structure and naming patterns. Names for folders and files are retrieved from the file's id3tag.

# Dependencies

The only dependencies are the mutagen library and python2 (unfortunately mutagen doesn't have support for python 3 yet =( )
